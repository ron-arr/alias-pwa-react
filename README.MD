# Alias game

Digital version of the classic board game Alias.
[Read about this game on wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(board_game)>).

The current version contains only [Russian words](https://github.com/ron-arr/alias-words), but you can also easily replace words by specifying another dependency with a similar structure.
